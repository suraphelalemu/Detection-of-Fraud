Recommendations

    For e-commerce fraud detection, the Logistic Regression model provides the best balance between precision and recall.
    For credit card fraud detection, the XGBoost model performs best.
    Both models should be monitored regularly as fraud patterns evolve.
    Consider implementing a hybrid approach with rule-based systems for high-risk transactions.
